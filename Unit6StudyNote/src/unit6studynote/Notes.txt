Developing projects involves a process similar to movies (with the script and storyboard), and Construction (with blueprints)
A system is a combination of software (and sometimes hardware) that provides a solution for a problem
A system involves: The client, Analysts, Designers & developers, Testers, and Users
Question for measuring success: Does the project solve what it was meant to solve?
Question for measuring success: Is it easy to maintain and administer?
Question for measuring success: Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client?
Question for measuring success: Is there a successful support system in place for the client?
Question for measuring success: Was it delivered on time and ready to go?
Question for measuring success: Was the client happy with the finished product?
A mistake made in one phase often requires the developer to backup and redo some of the work in the previous phase is called the waterfall model
the ‘software development life cycle’ (SDLC) is a view of the software development process created by computer scientists
The phases of the waterfall model are: Problem statement, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Integration/Test, Maintenance
The Waterfall model was created by Dr Winston Royce in 1970 from his experience in developing software for spacecraft mission planning
Mistakes found in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found later
The cost of developing developing software is not spread equally over the phases
The project management tools: Gantt Chart, UML, Daily Log, Weekly Reports, Communication
The gantt chart was developed in 1910 by a mechanical engineer Henry Gantt
The gantt chart helps project managers to visualize, schedule, and track scheduled as well as actual progress of projects
UML stands for Unified Modeling Language
UML specifies parts of a system
UML is used for complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually
JAR stands for Java Archive
A JAR is a compressed file with a .java extension
A JAR file can be double-clicked and ran
A JAR file allows us to easily share our programs with other people
To make a JAR file in netbeans, click the "Clean and build" button which creates a JAR file in the dist folder
